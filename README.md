# club-website
 This is for the IGEM2021 website. (js)
The external fork is from my github. (js)
We can move it out of it later. (js)
I created an empty folder and CSS file for all the css for the website. (js)
I created a folder for the html as well as adding the page you had me work on(js).
You can add a js file to it if you want to.(js)
I created a main folder for images for the website and than divided it into other nested folders(team_member_photos, icons, and main_photos). Team photos are for the photos of the IGEM members. Icons are for the icons that can be used for the navigation bar. Main_photos are for main photos that will be used on the home page and the other pages.(js)
